# Goals for this Checkpoint

For this checkpoint, we sought to investigate the following questions

 - Are officers with more than one allegation against them more likely to commit misconduct in groups against Black residents than non-Black residents?
 - Are officers who commit misconduct in multiple categories (implying each officer has at least two complaints against them) more likely to commit misconduct against Black residents than non-Black residents in specific categories?

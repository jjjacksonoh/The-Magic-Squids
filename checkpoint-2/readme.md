In this checkpoint we try to answer the following questions:

1. What is the relationship between the proportion of black residents in a district and the number of complaints per capita
2. What is the breakdown of number of complaints by race for each complaint type

Disregard the .twbr file in the src directory.  For question 1, run the code in src.sql under the first question.  There are two queries which should be executed separately.    For question 2 there is only one query.  The graph displayed after running the code for the first question displays an upward trending line, indicating a positive correlation between allegations per capita and proportion of black residents.  The graph displayed after running the code for the second question demonstrates how for nearly all allegation types, black residents have the highest proportion of that complaint type.

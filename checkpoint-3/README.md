To run the code in the src file, open the code in the stacked_grouped.html file.  Then run the code to open a webpage.  The link in the top left corner of the page switches to the other view.  This will open the stacked bar graphs.  To open the heat map, run the index.html file.  Doing so should open a webpage with the heatmap.  We used the Live Server extension in VSCode to open/run our webpages.
